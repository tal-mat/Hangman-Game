# Blog Front-End

The front-end of the blog application, built with React, offers a seamless and interactive user experience. 
It allows users to browse, read, and manage blog posts with features such as post creation, editing, and deletion. U
sers can search and filter content, and the application is integrated with Google authentication to ensure secure and easy access. I
t communicates with a Node.js server for the back-end and PostgreSQL for the database.
